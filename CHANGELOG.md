### Changed

- Clarified ADR 0002 graph roots, module extensions, partial-result opt-in, query

  context exclusions, declaration identity, and bounded query continuation rules.
- Closed the source graph contract gaps for diagnostic identity and pagination,
  exclusion and generated-file authority, standard-library context, #23–#25 query
  mappings, edge locations/status, repository naming, package type validation, and
  deterministic fixture requirements.
